# Grid

Grid takes input from the user and creates a grid on the screen. This project in under construction.

## Getting Started

### Usage

* There are two fields to enter numbers.:
* The first is dimensions. The dimensions will generate the size of the grid.
* The second is divisions. The divisions field will determine how many lines to generate both vertically and horizontally.
* Finally there is a color picker. The color picker will color your grid.

## Contributing

* I'm still learning some of the basics. If you have any ways to improve the generation of the grid, or how to label the inputs, that would be helpful.
